;Overwatch Hero Recommendation System
;Author:        Spenser Mason
;Description:   This expert system will recommend a hero to start out with for newcomers to the video game Overwatch.
;Usage:         The easiest way to run this system is to run CLIPS from the command line with this file as the -f option.
;               e.g: CLIPSDOS64.exe -f project2.clp
